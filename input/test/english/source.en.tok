mass slaughter on a personal level
peter englund ' s intense and bighearted new book , " the beauty and the sorrow : an intimate history of the first world war , " begins with a long dramatis personae of the sort that can make your heart sink .
mr. englund is a swedish historian and journalist .
he is also the new permanent secretary of the swedish academy , which awards the nobel prize in literature .
what he has written here is an unusual book , one he describes , not inaccurately , as " a work of anti- history . "
it ' s not so much a book about what happened , he explains , as " a book about what it was like . " it ' s about " feelings , impressions , experiences and moods . "
" the beauty and the sorrow " threads together the wartime experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women , on both sides of the war , from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers , doctors , ambulance drivers and clerks .
a few of these people will become heroes .
mr. englund ' s book is a deviation from standard history books .
it is a corrective too to the notion that world war i was only about the dire trench warfare on the western front .
